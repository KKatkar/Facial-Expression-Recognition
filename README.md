# Facial-Expression-Recognition

Developed convolutional neural networks to identify emotion through facial expression.

### Dataset
fer2013.csv (link) :  https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data
### Phases
<ul>
<li> Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
<li> Preprocessing and Normalizing data</li>
<li> Data Augmentation</li>
<li> Build and Train CNN models for mutil-label classification</li>
<li> Test and Evaluation </li>
</ul>

### Key takeaways:
<li> Understanding model's training performances and identifying overfitting.</li>
<li> Implementing measures against overfitting - Early stopping and Dropout; and observing measurable improvement. </li>
<li> Increasing diversity and quantity of data by configuring and using Data augmentation generators. </li>
<li> Plotting the expression (image) and distribution of prediction to develop an understanding of misclassifications so that model can be improved in the right areas going ahead.
